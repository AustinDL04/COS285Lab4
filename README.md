## The Task and How it went

We were tasked with utilizing GitHub, command-line arguments, binary trees, and recursive functions to implement methods. After configuring the repository, we made both the breadth and recursive search methods using notes from class. Once done, we tested it with the IntelliJ command line, and it successfully compiled and ran as expected.

## How to run our file

By navigating to the file through CMD or using the built-in function to pass arguments within IntelliJ, by passing the file in question as an argument, or running `java Lab4.java data.txt` while at the file location, it will run successfully.
